# sandbox

These are sandbox/playground codes to test random things for other projects,
and quick scripts for homework problems.

Each subfolder is my attempts with a new language, usually starting with a
hello world script and some command line operations.

Some subfolders are for different topics. I have a subfolder for implementing
image processing algorithms and another for trying out the phoenix framework
for Elixir.
