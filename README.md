# sandbox

These are sandbox/playground codes to test random things for other projects,
and quick scripts for homework problems.

Each subfolder is my attempts with a new language, usually starting with a
hello world script and some command line operations.

### Languages to Try:

- [x] C
- [x] Python
- [x] Shell
- [x] Ruby
- [x] Go
- [x] Brainfuck
- [ ] Swift
- [ ] Scala
